These experimental micro-brew beers use the [Breugelse Rooije Red Ale](/post/breugelse-rooije-red-ale) as the "base beer". So I have an active yeast/brew and then topping it of with homegrow/homemade fruit juice. The fruit juice was made by pasteurisation at 70 degrees celsius. And preserved in the freezer at -18 degrees celsius, ready to be used for brew time.

During bottle at 16 June per beer 500ml of [Mr White](/post/jerrys-mr-white/) batch was added for active yeast.

**Double red fruity**

A nice amount of [Red currant berries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redcurrant) where given by a collegue and [pasturized at 70 degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization) to get rid of the [wild fermentation bacteria and yeasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast_in_winemaking#Wild_yeasts_and_natural_fermentation). The berries where frozen first for preservation and to break the cell walls to extract more juice from them.

```
 Beer amount: 2250 ml
Juice amount: 1250 ml
              ---------
       Total: 3.5 liter

End result: 3250 ml (with 19,5 gr cane sugar for bottling [6gr/liter)
```

**Beer-n-grapes**

The beer-n-grapes contains red grape juice which was a little sugared during juice extraction. The grapes where very sweet and not much tangy sourness.

```
 Beer amount: 1775 ml
Juice amount: 1600 ml
              -----------
       Total: 3.375 liter

End result: 3750 ml (with 22,5 gr cane sugar for bottling [6gr/liter])
