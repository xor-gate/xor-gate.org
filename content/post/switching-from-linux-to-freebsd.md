So after more than fifteen years of experience my main development and server operating system was [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) based. Which ranged from [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu) as early as [5.04 (April 2005)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history#Ubuntu_5.04_(Hoary_Hedgehog)), [Slackware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware), [Arch Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux) and [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian) are in the category of advanced user and stability.

The biggest problem in my opinion with the Linux based operating system is its widely distributed software components spread accros to many websites, projects and communities. APIs change all the time, documentation is outdated or even lacking. This is also because the speed of where new features are implemented are to fast to be understand by others and deprectated before they even see daylight.

In the BSD communities the old [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)is still praised over complexity. 

This year I started a project for my own company and wanted something which is centralised and well documented.
