I love peppers, and this year i'm taking a community garden sabbatical. I will put my north facing balcony full of peppers. I'm using my [previous build growing box](/post/grow-and-go-prototype/) but sowing the peppers laboratory style in petri dishes with a heating mat.

I needed to add some cardboard between the petri dishes and heating mat because the water would evaporate to fast. And adding some extra cotton swaps on top sprinkled with water. It only took 10 days to sprout them all !
