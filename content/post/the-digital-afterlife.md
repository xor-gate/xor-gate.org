What about the digital traces we leave behind on the internet after we pass away? When your most important accounts are secured with two-factor authentication it is impossible to recover. People who are left behind probably have no clue how to access your most important internet accounts and data of value like family pictures.

My most important account is my private Google account. Where I have stored my contacts and e-mail, and a backup of data of value for me. Because I only use exclusivly Apple products for desktop, laptop and smartphone purposes I also have a secured Apple ID.

Apple has the ["Legacy Contact"](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212360). And Google has the ["Inactive Account Manager"](https://myaccount.google.com/inactive). So your account and data can be recovered with your death certificate or is released after account inactivity.

I'm a little paranoid so for every internet account I create a different password and store it in a Keepass encrypted database. On macOS I use MacPass. On Windows at work I use [KeePass XC](https://keepassxc.org/) with [Chrome browser plugin](https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_GettingStarted#_setup_browser_integration).

**The just-in-case box**

You should prepare for the worst and create a small box with printed information like:

* Internet (e-mail) accounts like: Google, Apple, Microsoft
* Most important phone numbers like work, clubs, friends, family etc.
* List of subscriptions with client or contract numbers
* List of contacts to send a death notice to
* Smartphone pincode
* Smartphone SIM-card pin/puk code
* Computer password(s)
* For the digital paranoid
  * Yubi hardware encryption key
  * Disk encryption keys
* ... and the list goes on

The box could contain an USB stick FAT32 formatted (synced every 31 march on [World Backup Day](https://www.worldbackupday.com/en)) for maximum OS compatibility. My USB stick also contains an encrypted Keepass password and account database.

So how are you prepared for the digital afterlife?
