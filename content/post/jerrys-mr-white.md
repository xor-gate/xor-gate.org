The base of this brew is a Brewferm Mr White brew kit for ["witbier"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/witbier) a top-fermented barley/wheat beer brewed mainly in Belgium and the Netherlands. It is a kit for 20 liters, and was split into two ~9.5 liter wort batches in the fermenter.

We measured around [10 brix](https://www.brewersfriend.com/brix-converter/) of the 20 liters which is 5.2% ABV. The kit stated it was around 5.5% ABV. So the brew was not bad. Also the bottle prime sugar for carbonation adds a little alcohol to the end product.

# Ingredients

The Brewferm Mr White brew kit contained unscrapt malt: Wheat and Barley. And unmalted Wheat and Oats flakes. And two types of hops.

We added extras for the 20 liter brew:
