> NOTICE: This experiment failed again. The peppers where almost free of aphids. But probably central heating and darkness killed them. No more tries to overwinter peppers for me! I just sow them [very early in Januari](/post/peppers-2024/).

So I finally found a [good overwintering peppers tutorial (Pepper Geek on Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wo3bwp5uQA&t=876s) with peppers plants grown outside. I'm going to try again and do my best to keep them alive until the 2023 grow season starts.

Normally I had big issues with aphids because they did hide in the soil taken from outside to inside. Even after de-foliage and trimming the aphids got alive when new leafs where forming.

I did sow them this year myself in Januari, in my custom build [Grow and go box prototype](/post/grow-and-go-prototype/).

We will see in the upcomming months...
