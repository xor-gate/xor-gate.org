So I harvested some awesome vegetables and need to hack a recipe together? So I came up with:

* [Smoked bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon) approx 200gr
* [Green Field Peas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pea#Field_pea)
* [Celery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celery)
* [Chives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chives)
* Some [black pepper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_pepper) to taste
