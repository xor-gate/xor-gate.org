Attempt for an extra dry red ale. First time I added 5% all-purpose white wheat flour to become hopefully a extra clear beer due to extra gluten.

**Mash scheme**

Step-mash using Brew-in-a-bag (BIAB) method

| Type          | Time      | Temperature (celsius) |
| ------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| Mash-in       | -         | 45 degree             |
| Protein rest  | 30 min    | 50 degree             |
| Beta amylase  | 2.5 hours | 63 degree             |
| Alpha amylase | 30 min    | 73 degree             |
| Flame-out     | -         | 78 degree             |
| Boil          | 60 min    | 100 degree            |

I mashed-in with enough water so I could add boiling water for the other steps. I constantly stirred during heating and addition of the boiling water. Adding the boiling water will speed up temperature ramp-up and prevent burning of the mash.
