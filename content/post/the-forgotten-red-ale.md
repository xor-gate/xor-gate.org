So finaly I decided to bottle my long overdue sour red ale experiment with cranberries and lemon.
The citra hop smell and flavor has oxidized but it still tastes like a nice tangy fresh summer beer.

The cranberries where fresh picked during my new year vacation in 2018-2019 at the [Dutch island Terschelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terschelling#Cranberries).
