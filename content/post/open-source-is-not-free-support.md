Open-source software doesn't mean its free as in breathing air, getting free support and complaining when a feature is not present even not donating to the effort. (Re)licensing open-source is a different hot-debate, i'm a developer not a lawyer but for me open-source is a philosophical thing. Open-source maintainers and contributors should be respected (,and respect each other) in the sense it's mostly pro-bono work. Which maintainer wants to get flamed and payed nothing for keeping their hard work free and open-source?
