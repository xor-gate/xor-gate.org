The Apple Red Ale beer is a split from the [Autumn Dry Irish Red Ale](/post/autumn-dry-irish-red-ale/) . It includes 48% pasteurized apple juice I got from an apple tree of a collegue during the second fermentation. The batch size in the fermenter is 10,5 liters. And final bottles where 24x 33cl (7,92 liters).

It was dryhopped with a few handfuls of old cascade flowers.
