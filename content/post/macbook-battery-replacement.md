So after many years it was time to replace my battery of my Macbook Pro 
(Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013). Model MacBookPro11,1. Thanks to the people at [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/) I was 
able to order a replacement battery and some spare time to keep it running for a few more
years. Luckily this model has no issues with its keyboard. For most things I do its still fast enough.

Here is a list of pictures during replacement together with my friend [maartentamboer](https://github.com/maartentamboer).

And luckily it worked like a charm!
