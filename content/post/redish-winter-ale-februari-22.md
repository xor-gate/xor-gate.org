Attempt for a malty and sweet [irish red ale](https://learn.kegerator.com/irish-red-ale/) low in alcohol. The beer came out a little less red then expected but is probably due too the chocolate malts. The red color oxidized fast till amber/brown. The taste came out smooth and malty, luckily the bottle fermentation didn't produce much carbonation.

# Brewlog

- [Bottle ID 183](/post/beer-cellar/)
- ABV 4.57% (75% efficiency)
- IBUÂ 24.99
- EBC 18.31
- Yeast: Fermentis Safale K-97, dry ale yeast. Sedimentation: slow, Attentuation: high. 
- Fermentor target: 33 liter

**Mash scheme**

Single infusion mash with initial water temperature of 73 degree celsius. Mash at 66 degree for 90 minutes.
Using the Brew-in-a-bag (BIAB) for filtering and brew-speed. BIAB works as a good filter so the mash will not
cool significantly. I don't use a filtering bucket anymore because making a filter bed takes too much time to
settle and the wort cools by 10-20 degrees during this step.

I heated the wort to 78 degree and sparged spent grain with 80 degree water until running clear. Topped to 33
liter during cooling.
