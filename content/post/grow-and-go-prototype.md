I love peppers and own a community garden. Because my appartement living room is north facing there is not much heat and light from the sun. So I decided to build a growing box with some scrap materials I had laying around. The specifications:

* Transparent plastic box with lid
* 72 watt 12 volt power supply
* 54 watt led strips mix of white, blue and red
* Cardboard
* Thin rope
* 12V PC fan
* Duc/transparent tape
* Plug tray for planting
* Thermometer
* Philips Hue smart plug as timer. Scheduled from 7h-18h so 11h of light.

For sprouting I used:

* Heating mat 5W
* Plastic petri dishes 55mm
* Kitchen paper towel
* Cotton pads
* Tweezers

It took approximate 7-10 days for sprouting. The best sprouted seedlings where transplanted as soon as possible.

I control the grow box humidity by leaving the lid with a small airgap by moving the grips up. The heat of the led strips is contained within the box and heats the box between 20-25 degrees celsius. No external heat is applied.
